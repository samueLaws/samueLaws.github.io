Units:
Pix: pX,pY.
Cell: cX,cY.
Chunk: kX,kY.


Pix is the pixel value as used in mouse coordinates and when drawing to the scene



Cell is the cell coordinates as if they were all part of the same array, but centered around the 0,0 chunk.

Inner cell coordinates is cell % chunkWidth

Chunk is the coordinates of the chunk, Cell = (Pix % Chunk.Size)/Cell.Size




-Ideas for progress
    -Interface
    //Camera controls
    //Step controls
    //alt rule set

    -Program improvements

    //should cell groups that are stable be continually processed?

    //Prune the chunks that haven't been used in a long time, and are far from other chunks, like removing them.

    //adapt the auto frame time to slow down automatically as processing slows.
    //if the frame takes over 1 second to draw disable auto processing

    //implement methods to change the customRules within chunkManager

    //history extention, more than 2 sides to the board.

    //save and load board configs 

    //fill the background of chunks, for more consistent filling

    //implement an ordered chunk storage system, related to the position of the chunks. could be a spacial hash map

    //add an option to color the undrawn frames the same as the background

    //add graph to show past rule times

    //show how many steps are left in current run.
